Player agility plot depicts the agility and ball control of players playing in different positions (Forward, Midfield, Back or Goalkeeper) and who have different body shapes (lean, normal or stock). Midfielders in general have very high agility compared to players who play at different positions. Players who are lean have more agility in all positions compared to normal and stock body types. Forward and midfield players in general have more ball control. Agility and ball control are positively correlated when ball control is less than average of all players. If player posess average ball control, he most likely to be most agile.
