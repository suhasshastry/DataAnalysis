# Data analysis
This repo has various data analysis projects. Below is the list of projects along with the links to their reports.

### [Epilepsy data](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Epilepsy/epilepsy.pdf)
An explorative data analysis was done on Epilepsy data to analyze seizure pattern using clustering and classification techniques. PCA, Factor analysis, Machine Learning algorithms like Hierarchical clustering, K-Means clustering, KNN classification and Random Forest were implemented for this data set.

### [FIFA 2019](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/FIFA/readme.md)
Players attributes are visualized using Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/suhas.shastry#!/vizhome/FIFA_15515893209100/Dashboard1?publish=yes)

### [Absenteeism](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/absenteeism/absenteeism.ipynb)
Absenteeism at work dataset is a collection of demographic data of employees in a Brazil firm who were absent for work. Various relationships are visualized interactively using Python libraries. This is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.

### [Hawkes Process](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Hawkes%20process/report/hawkes_report.pdf)
Chicago burglary data was modeled using Hawkes process. KS test was done on the simulated Hawkes process data and
crime dataset to check the goodness of fit.

### [Pesticides data](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Pesticides/analysis.pdf)
Logistic, probit and c log-log regression models were used to analyze impact of doses and effects of different pesticides.

### [Bayesian ETAS](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Bayesian%20ETAS/report.pdf)
Japan earthquake data was modeled using Bayesian version of ETAS declustering model.

### [Hidden Markov Models in Time series](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/HMM/report.pdf)
Stock market indices of BRICS countries were analyzed using two state Hidden Markov Model.
