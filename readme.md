# Data analysis
This repo has various data analysis projects. Below is the list of projects along with the links to their reports.

### [Profitable localities for Pizza shop in Bangalore](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Pizza/report1.ipynb)
•	Created a predictive model to understand the most profitable neighborhood in Bangalore for a pizza shop outlet using [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/) APIs.

### [Visualization of Absenteeism data in Python](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/absenteeism/absenteeism.ipynb)
•	Visualized various factors and relationships causing Absenteeism in a Brazil firm using Python. This is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.

### [Spatial Poisson Regression of Dinner Restaurants in Bangalore](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Dinner/project.pdf)
•	Analyzed spatial effect of all the dinner restaurants in Bangalore as point process. Modelled this data as Spatial Poisson Regression model in R using Gibbs sampling to estimate the parameters.

### [Exploratory data analysis of Epilepsy data](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Epilepsy/epilepsy.pdf)
•	Analyzed Epilepsy data in R to identify seizure pattern. PCA, Factor analysis, Machine Learning algorithms like Hierarchical clustering, K-Means clustering, KNN classification and Random Forest were implemented for this data set. 

### [Regression model fitting on Pesticides data](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Pesticides/analysis.pdf)
•	Modeled pesticides data with Logistic, probit and c log-log regression equations in R to analyze impact of doses and effects of different pesticides.

### [Visualization of FIFA 2019 data using Tableau](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/FIFA/readme.md)
•	FIFA 2019 dataset was cleaned in OpenRefine and players skills, wages and worth were visualized in Tableau dashboard.

### [Spatial data analyis of Parana State’s average rainfall](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Parana%20rainfall/report.pdf)
•	Spatial analysis was employed using Exponential covariance model in R to predict the rainfall across the state.

### [Simulation of Hawkes Process](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Hawkes%20process/report/hawkes_report.pdf)
•	Simulated clustered Poisson process to fit Chicago burglary data. Tested goodness of fit using KS test.

### [Model fitting of earthquake data using Bayesian ETAS](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/Bayesian%20ETAS/report.pdf)
•	Modelled Japan Earthquake catalog using Bayesian version of ETAS model.

### [Analysis of Time series data using Hidden Markov Model](https://github.com/suhasshastry/DataAnalysis/blob/master/HMM/report.pdf)
•	Analyzed stock market indicies of BRICS countries using 2 state Hidden Markov Model.
