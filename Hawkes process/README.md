# Hawkes Process

The goal of project is to simulate Hawkes Process. I am considering Hawkes process with exponentially decaying intensity. This project gives a brief introduction to Poisson process and extends it to Hawkes process. Function 'hawkes' which takes three parameters as input simulates the process. Function 'hawkes_ll' calculates the log likelihood equation which is used to obtain MLEs of the parameters.

Hawkes process was modeled on Chicago burglary dataset by maximizing the log likelihood equation. KS test was done on the simulated Hawkes process data and crime dataset to check the goodness of fit.
